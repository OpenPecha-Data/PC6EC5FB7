When the Lord had spoken thus, the bodhisattva Great Being Siṃhavikrāntagāmin addressed him:In
the future, there will be bodhisattvas with naive views on emptiness, naive views on the
absence of distinguishing marks and wishful thinking, naive views on non-origination, the
absence of characteristics, naive views on the Buddha and Awakening.And further, they will
be within the scope of speeches on emptiness and signlessness, attached to sacred sayings,
purifiers of syllables, having great respect for speech activity, giving authority to
proverbs and names. Those bodhisattvas, having heard this letterless and ineffable teaching
of the Tathāgata, will give up those views, understand the one principle of all moments
of existence, and teach religion to beings in accordance with their faith.being well trained
in expedient means they will talk about moderation, but they will not seek purity thereby;they
will talk about contentment, but they will not seek purity thereby;they will talk
about austerity, but they will not seek purity thereby.They will proclaim the faults in being
with the crowd and will have faith that all moments of existence really are something
set apart [from impurities].They will proclaim praise of living alone, not mixing with people,
but they will not seek purity thereby;they will proclaim praise of producing the thought
of Awakening, but they will know that the essence of thought is Awakening;they will proclaim
praise of the extended religious text, but they will know that it is rather the moments
of existence which are extended.They will talk of bodhisattvas, but they will not believe
in any differences between the disciples, the isolated awakened ones and Buddhas.They
will proclaim praise of generosity, but they will penetrate the sameness of generosity;they
will proclaim praise of morality, but they will penetrate the essence of morality;they
will proclaim praise of tolerance, but their views will be those concerned with the state
of things as perishable, mutable and non-originated;they will proclaim praise of effort, but
they will penetrate all moments of existence as without exertion and endeavour.They will
teach the completion of meditation, concentration and the states of concentration, by means
of hundred of thousands of millions of millions of ways into them, but they will see that
all moments of existence are by nature in a state of concentration;they will proclaim
praise of insight in a thousand ways, but they will truly know that all moments of existence
have the basic nature of both insight and bad insight.They will proclaim the disgrace of
passion, but still they will not see any impassioned moment of existence;they will proclaim
the blame of aggression, but still they will not see any enraged moment of existence;they
will proclaim the blame of delusion, but still they will relate to all moments of existence
as without delusion and hindrances.They will proclaim fear of hell, animal existence
and the world of ñama, but still they will apprehend neither hell, an animal existence nor
the world of ñama.They will teach religion to beings in accordance with their faith;that
is, to those with faith in the one principle [they will teach] by means of faith in emptiness,
to those with faith in the one principle [they will teach] by means of faith in the
absence of distinguishing marks, faith in non-origination, faith in non-existence and absence
of characteristics.Thus, Lord, the words ’ability in expedient means’ are not something
for the disciples and the isolated awakened ones, nor for bodhisattvas Great Beings who
have recently joined the Way. It is, however, fuite another matter with those who have deep
faith, who have faith in the one principle; to these one should use the words ’ability in
expedient means’, which is within the scope of their faith.
