When this had been said, the crown prince Mañjuśrī addressed himself to the Lord:That by means
of which the mind is known to be only a designation, this is the practice of awareness
which consists in considering the mind as the mind.That by means of which no good or bad moment
of existence is apprehended, this is the practise of awareness which consists in considering
the moment of existence as moment of existence.
