A long time ago, son of good family, in times past, uncountable world-ages ago, even more uncountable,
extended, immeasurable, unthinkable, unmeasured, even longer, and longer ago than
that, at that time a Tathāgata, a śaint, a completely awakened Lord Buddha by the name
of Mervabhyudgatarāja was born in the world.The life-span of that Tathāgata was ninety-nine
thousand million billion years,and the name of his world was Kanakārcis, which was made
up of golden things.By means of three ways the beings there attained nirvāṇa.In that world
bushes and trees were made of the substance of jewels, and from these trees such sounds were
emitted as the sound of emptiness, the sound of signlessness, the sound of absence of
wishful thinking, the sound of non-arising, the sound of non-cessation, the sound of no essential
nature, the sound of absence of essential characteristics; and as these sounds were
emitted, the minds of these beings were freed.When that Tathāgata had reached nirvāṇa the
teaching lasted for a thousand years, but after that those sounds were no longer emitted
from those trees.Son of good family, that Tathāgata Mervabhyudgatarāja impelled the preacher
of religion, the monk named Viśuddhacāritra to hold on to the true teaching, and then
he entered nirvāṇa.At that time, son of good family, there was also a monk named Cāritramati,
who believed in very severe practices, and he was perfected in the rules of the most pure
morality, and had even attained the five worldly supernatural knowledges he was an expert
in monastic rules, and the asceticism of that monk was frightening.He founded a monastery,
where he stayed, and he established his followers in the rules of most pure morality,
putting his faith in the vows concerning the fualities of purification. That monk was vigorous,
and always stayed with the thought of Awakening;he urged other bodhisattvas to adopt
that kind of behaviour, and he thus urged them to adopt preconceived views: he made them
hold on to the dictum that all conditioned things are impermanent, he made them hold on to
the dictum that all conditioned things are suffering, he made them hold on to the dictum
that all conditioned things are selfless. That monk became an expert on concentration, but
he did not become an expert on the behaviour of a bodhisattva. ṅevertheless his roots of
good were perfected.The preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra was expert in knowing
the excellent and weak abilities of living beings, and his followers, as many as they
were, all of them excelled in their vows concerning the fualities of purification, and they
were experts in expedient means, having the tolerance of being without any preconceived
views.Son of good family, then the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra came with
his followers to the monastery where the monk Cāritramati lived, and stayed there. And from
that monastery they went into the town, out of compassion, and when they had conducted
the meal ritual [of mendicancy] they returned.Among these beings Viśuddhacaritra made many
hundred thousand groups of beings believe, and his followers, as many as they were, became
proficient in the art of religious leadership. Going to them they taught religion to the
living beings, and they established many hundred thousands of living beings in the incomparable
complete Awakening. But the followers of Cāritramati were only intent on meditation,
and they never went for alms-rounds in the town.Then the monk Cāritramati produced thoughts
of disbelief in those other bodhisattvas, and he sounded the gong; having assembled the
congregation of monks he made an order: No one among us should go to the town. And he admonished
Viśuddhacāritra’s followers: You practise without the proper mindfulness, and you
talk too much. And what are you doing by going to the town? The Lord has admonished us and
praised us that we should live in seclusion, thus you should not go to the town but practise
with the joy of meditation!But they did not listen to what he said and went to the town
again. And, son of good family, then, when those monks came back from the town, Cāritramati
sounded the gong again, and having assembled the congregation of monks he admonished
them saying: If from now on you go to town, you cannot stay in this monastery.Then, son of
good family, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra called on his entourage
for the sake of protecting the mind of that monk, and said: ṅone of you should again go to
the town. But then, at that time, all the living beings who had been educated by those monks
did not meet those monks anymore, and became exceedingly sad, and their roots of good
were also obscured.Then, son of good family, after three months, the preacher of religion,
the monk Viśuddhacāritra, moved from that monastery on to another monastery, and his monks
went again to the towns, the villages, to the smaller places and to the courts of the kings’
palaces to teach religion to the people.Then, son of good family, the monk Cāritramati
saw the preacher of religion Viśuddhacāritra go again and again to the town, and having
seen the vulgar behaviour of his entourage, he again produced thoughts of disbelief: This
monk has bad morality, perverted morality, how can he reach Awakening? And he said on many
occasions: The Awakening of this monk is far away, this monk keeps on mixing with people.Then,
son of good family, at another time, the monk Cāritramati became affected by the forces
of death, and when in this way he had been affected by the forces of death, he fell by
the maturing of his deeds into the great hell of Avīci. Having experienced feelings of suffering
in the great hell for ninety-nine thousand times ten millions of world ages, he experienced
having a bad reputation for sixty-three thousand births. Then, after having adopted
a monk’s life for thirty-two thousand births, his deeds again balanced out.Because of
the rest of those hindrances of past deeds he adopted a monk’s life in the teachings of the
Tathāgata, the saint, the complete Buddha Vimalārcismat, and after having adopted a monk’s
life he could, after six hundred thousand times ten millions of years practice in such
a way that his head seemed to be on fire, but he did not attain tolerance in accordance with
the teachings, and for many hundred thousand births his abilities were moderate.At that
time, son of good family, on that occasion, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra,
do you think he was someone else? dho not look at it that way. And why? The Tathāgata
Akṣobhya was at that time, on that occasion, the preacher of religion, the monk Viśuddhacāritra.
At that time, son of good family, on that occasion, if you think the preacher of
religion, the monk Cāritramati, was someone else, you should not look at it that way. And
why? Because I was that preacher of religion, the monk Cāritramati. And I made those thoughts
of unbelief arise in him through these too subtle means, and by the forces of hindrances
from past deeds fell into the hells.
