Son of good family, [since the hindrances of deeds are to that extent subtle, son of good family,]
those who do not wish to be connected with such hindrances of deeds, should not have
any hostility against any of the practices of another bodhisattva. They should rather have
faith in all his undertakings.One should think thus: I do not know the thoughts of others;
the behaviour of living beings is hard to understand.chonsidering the meaning of this,
the TathƒÅgata taught the dharma thus: A person should not judge another; it is only for me,
or someone like me, to judge another person.The one, son of good family, who wishes to
protect himself should not question the practice of any other, nor should he criticize others,
thinking: This one is like this, this one like that.He should, rather, day and night,
cultivate himself, intent on the religion of the Buddha, with a mind absorbed in religion.

Son of good family, the bodhisattva who is well established in his practice in accordance with
his intentions, with a mind intent on cultivating religion, he does not behave so as to
engage in criticism of others.Son of good family, if some bodhisattva established all the
living beings in the three thousand great thousand worlds on the way of the ten good actions,
if that were to be compared with a bodhisattva staying by himself detached from the world,
who just for a very short moment, a mere snap of the fingers, believed that all moments
of existence are of one principle, or even would just briefly take some time to ask about
that, consider it, learn it and study it, this last would be more effective as far as
the increase of merit is concerned.Why? Son of good family, if bodhisattvas understand this
principle, they will attain the purification of all hindrances of deeds, and become without
attachment or aversion towards all living beings; they will soon attain knowledge of every
aspect of existence.
