Then the bodhisattva, the Great being Siṃhavikrāntagāmī said this to the Lord:Lord, how many
beings will profit upon hearing these versified teachings?When this had been said, the Lord
said this to the bodhisattva, the great being Siṃhavikrāntagāmī: Son of good family, do
you see this circle of followers?And he said: Yes, Lord, I see them. Living beings beyond
count have arrived for this teaching, all of space is full of them, Lord, gods, demons, celestial
musicians, titans, divine birds, centaurs, great serpents and many beings from other
universes, and they have heard this teaching of religion.The Lord said: Here, son of good
family, ninety-eight thousand gods have attained tolerance to the fact that all moments
of existence are unborn; in ninety-two thousand demons the thought of incomparable perfect
Awakening has arisen; in thirty-six thousand snake gods the thought of Awakening has arisen.There
were also five hundred conceited monks who had the idea that they had attained
something they had not attained, but upon hearing this teaching of religion completely bereft
of conceit, they got faith that every moment of existence is of one principle, and their
minds became free of defilements because of the fact that they did not grasp for anything
anymore.In this crowd of bodhisattvas there are sixty-two thousand bodhisattvas who have
gotten faith in the fact that there are no moments of existence which represent a hindrance,
and this attained the tolerance that all moments of exitence are unborn.And why did this
happen? This teaching of religion has attained excellence among religious teachings.I
got faith in the teaching of the one principle of all moments of existence in the presence
of the Buddha dhīpaṃkara, and then I attained the tolerance that moments of existence are
unborn.Son of good family, that which it is to attain all the six perfections, and which
it is to have heard this religious teaching, they are the same thing.Son of good family, if
the bodhisattvas great beings understand things this way, I do say they have completed the
six perfections.Why? If, son of good family, a bodhisattva stays on for as many world ages
as there are grains of sand in the river Gaṅ gā and gives gifts, guards morality, attains
tolerance, undertakes vigour, concentrates in meditation and acquires insight, that bodhisattva
might fall into preconceived viewpoints and lose again all those roots of the good,
if he has no knowledge of this religious discourse.Look, son of good family, at dhevadatta,
he had such roots of good; dhevadatta also had the thirty marks of a great man. dzven
though he had such roots of good, since he did not know this way of religion, he cut off
all those roots of the good and was born in the deepest hell.By this example one should know
that the roots of good of those who have not understood this way of religion, will be
destroyed.
