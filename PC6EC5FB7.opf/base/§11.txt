The bodhisattva who accuses someone by pointing out his mistakes is far from Awakening; he rather
incurs hindrances of actions.The bodhisattva who accuses someone by means of contempt
for certain practices is far from Awakening.The bodhisattva who accuses someone by means
of a certain behaviour is far from Awakening.If one produces a low opinion with regard to
another bodhisattva and a great opinion of himself, then he injures himself, and incurs hindrances
of actions.When a bodhisattva teaches or instructs another bodhisattva, he should
rather have an opinion of this bodhisattva as his teacher, and in that way he should teach
and instruct him.A bodhisattva should never produce a contemptuous attitude in the company
of another bodhisattva, that is, if he does not want to give up Awakening.Son of a god,
a bodhisattva never cuts off his roots of good by relating to another bodhisattva in the
way mentioned.
